1. Open Chrome.
2. In Chrome's Options menu (which visually appears as 3 vertical dots on the right, with a hint entitled “Customize and control Google Chrome”) choose More Options, then Extensions.  Alternatively you can type “chrome://extensions/” (without the quotes) in the Chrome location (url) bar.  NOTE:  My chrome instance has “More Tools” instead of “More Options”.
3. Check the "Developer Mode" checkbox or toggle button.  
4. Click the "Load unpacked extension" button and navigate to the simpleDevTools directory using the popup file browser.
5. The extention will appear in the developer tools panel as the "Simple" extension tab.
6. Close Chrome and Re-start.
